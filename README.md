# References and Resources for Neural Recommender Systems Research
This is a repository containing reference materials that may be helpful in jumpstarting your research on neural recommender systems, with special focus on collaborative filtering.

## Prelude: Types of Recommender Systems
* Content-Based Filtering 
* Collaborative Filtering
* Matrix Factorization

Kindly read this [PPT presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ZJ8eOqyEqvooXTdgwEW13sK2wpKmVLIEMhZ9wRrd0I/edit?usp=sharing) that details their differences and basic implementations.

## Foundation: Neural Collaborative Filtering
This time, we will talk about implementing collaborative filtering using deep learning and neural networks AKA neural collaborative filtering (NCF). This [PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qekyFWgY1jtF4fYHePFVYBYwey7dxz4WtPK4GC8KvM8/edit?usp=sharing) contains a brief summary about NCF. Yet, the full paper by He et al. (2017) may be accessed [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3038912.3052569?casa_token=PCPE6Y-KhqkAAAAA:8Zf5UV5HKgeUrlBqwitykc8WHpu_0eKVOO8lnNLhun8aON_TvLoQbvIqUFdHOAenjeEwsr57wt6Q7A).
